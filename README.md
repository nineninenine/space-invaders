# space-invaders
a python3 space invaders game as a covid19 shutdown project that i worked through from https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e 

I made this on a Mac, which requires homebrew for this to work. Visit https://brew.sh/ for deets, but tl;dr:

Install homebrew

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

Intstall a few libraries for pygame

`brew install hg sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf`

MacOS requires a slightly differnt version of pygame: 

`python3 -m pip install -U pygame==2.0.0.dev6 --user`

See https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted for details or if youre not using a mac.
