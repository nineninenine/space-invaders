# space-invaders
a space invaders game as a covid19 shutdown project

a project that i worked through from https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e

I made this on a Mac, which requires homebrew. Visit https://brew.sh/ for deets, but tl;dr

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"`

`â€œbrew install hg sdl sdl_image sdl_ttf`
